## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Perform basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Adjust between three themes to suit their preferences.
- View the calculator's design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Interact with both the calculator's buttons and physical keyboard for inputs.
- Save preferred themes on localStorage

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React- JS library
- JavaScript for functionality
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS for themes

### What I learned

During this project, I learned:

- Switching Themes:
  How to toggle between multiple themes using CSS variables and JavaScript.

- Keyboard Integration:
  Adding physical keyboard support by listening to 'keydown' events in JavaScript.

- Improved CSS Skills:
  I used Grid and Flex-box to create a clean, responsive layout for the calculator.

- JavaScript Logic:
  Handling edge cases like limit the display digits,leading zero, multiple zeros, dividing by zero and chaining operations helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key      | Function              |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `0-9`    | Enter numbers         |
| `+`      | Add                   |
| `-`      | Subtract              |
| `*`      | Multiply              |
| `/`      | Divide                |
| `Enter`  | Calculate the result  |
| `Delete` | Delete the last input |
| `Esc`    | Clear all inputs      |

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Add scientific calculator functions like square roots, exponents, and trigonometry.
- Improve accessibility by using ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - A great resource for understanding JavaScript events and CSS variables.
- CSS Tricks - Grid Guide - Helped me create the layout.
- Frontend Mentor Community - Valuable discussions and feedback.
- [SASS official Documents](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/)
